## Take the space battle console game you created and turn it into a browser based game
Get creative and come up with different ways your game could be played in the browser! There are no requirements. 

### Some ideas for getting started
- Create a modal that describes the game to the user
- Create a button that allows the user to choose whether to attack or retreat
- Show the alien ships and USS Margaret on the browser using an img
- Remove the alien ship as it is destroyed
- Display the USS Margaret's health as the ship is destroyed

... and so much more!
